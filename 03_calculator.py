# Concept: String and List

# Calculator

'''
You all have used a calculator. It is quite useful when we have simple and also complex calculations.

In general calculators

we will give 
25+345
30-20
30/4
and other operations to perform simple math calculations

Let us do the same thing where you will receive an input like the below

"25+345"

or "30-20"

Your task is to write a program that detects the symbol mentioned and performs the operations on the two operands and returns an integer answer
'''

import unittest

def calculator(expression):
  ans = 0
  # write your code here

  return ans

# DO NOT TOUCH THE BELOW CODE

class Dict_to_list(unittest.TestCase):
  def test_01(self):
    self.assertEqual(calculator("5+4"), 9)

  def test_02(self):
    self.assertEqual(calculator("54+46"), 100)

  def test_03(self):
    self.assertEqual(calculator("545-42"), 503)

  def test_04(self):
    self.assertEqual(calculator("5346/2"), 2673)
